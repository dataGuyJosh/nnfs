# Part 1 - Intro and Neuron Code
## Neural Network Calculations
- forward pass --> inputs * weights + biases
- structure
  - neurons
  - layers
    - input layer
    - hidden layers
    - output layer
- every neuron is connected to every other neuron in adjacent layers

# Part 2 - Coding a Layer
What is the input layer? There are usually values being tracked e.g. if predicting equipment failure, input values might be temperature, humidity and so on from sensors.
